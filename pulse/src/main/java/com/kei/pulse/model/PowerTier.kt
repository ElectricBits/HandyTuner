/**
 * The four PULSE performance tiers. On Snapdragon there is no programmable wattage cap
 * (unlike x86 AYANEO/AYASPACE), so each tier is a *power envelope* implemented by capping
 * the CPU clusters and the GPU to a fraction of their real top frequency. CUSTOM is manual.
 *
 * Factors are applied to each policy's true max frequency and snapped to a real OPP, so
 * the tiers stay valid on every device regardless of its actual frequency table.
 *
 * [governorLabel] is the smart-default CPU governor each preset re-asserts on apply (resolved
 * to a real kernel governor via GovernorController.OPTIONS at apply time; null = leave alone /
 * remembered separately for Custom). Labels match GovernorController.OPTIONS exactly.
